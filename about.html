                <h3 style="font-family: Goudy Old Style; padding-top:1px, margin-bottom:10px; text-align: center ">about</h3>

             
                  <p style=" padding-top:10px; margin-padding:10em; text-align: center" >Disclaimer: This concept maybe offensive to Christians and Facebook employees. </p>

<p style=" padding-top:1px; text-align: center" >As religion loses popularity in the modern age, technology gains greater influence. In the heyday of the Catholic Church(also known as the dark ages) it owned knowledge, now it is available for free on the internet. The Cyber Cathedral looks to marry the power of technology with religion, to give back authority to one of the world’s oldest, most sinister control mechanisms.</p>

<p style=" padding-top:1px; text-align: center" >The Cyber Cathedral is a social satire, making a comment about the relevance of religion in the modern age as people start use modern technology religiously. Most, if not all the Christians I know spend more time on facebook or their smart phone than at church or reading bible. Has technology become what the golden calf was to Israelites in exodus? However the Cyber Cathedral is not here to defend Christianity either, as far as I'm concerned organized religion isn't much better than organized crime, taking advantage of the gullible and scamming them out of their hard earned cash, whilst conforming their minds to make them obedient drones(obviously  not all religious leader do this – just most of them). This draws a parallel between social media networks which also present themselves in harmless fashion yet are arguably serving a much sinister purpose: collecting data and selling it to corporation whilst having the power to dictate what we look at and think about.</p>

<p style=" padding-top:1px; text-align: center" >The site has been designed to blatantly reference facebook, one goal is to hopefully get people thinking a little bit more about why they use facebook and if they really need it. With this in mind I have given the site a much darker look than facebook, as I want to portray social networking for what it really is, rather than using good design to make it look “user friendly”. It also gives it the look of a bible with often have dark leather covers and I chose a dirty cream colour to bring to mind the imagery of old bible pages.</p>  

<p style=" padding-top:1px; text-align: center" >
The profile page attempts to exaggerate the perverted nature of going to a persons facebook page to get information on a “friends” life without actually talking to them. I was also inspired from a scene in the social network where an acquaintance of fictional Mark Zuckerburg asks if a girl he is interested in is single. Zuckerburg responds “people don't walk around with a sign on them that says...” and races off to add the relationship status, explaining that “ this is what drives life at college; are you having sex or not?”.</p>

Not being a strong coder slowed me down and none of the pages are at the standard I would like, particularly the confessional booth page and the tithing page, while the profile page was  victim of some bad coding, leaving it somewhat unresponsive. In project three I hope to to develop these pages further and actually add some features that let you interact more these pages. For example adding a selection of donation options on the tithing page. </p>
